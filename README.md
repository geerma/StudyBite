## Inspiration
We were inspired by the theme: On-campus experience.

Many hours are lost over the course of the semester while looking for quiet places to study, or deciding on  which spots on campus have the best food. Our aim was to improve the on-campus experience for students by creating a web app that would reduce wasted time that can be invested into more productive tasks.

## What it does
StudyBite is an all-in-one mobile-responsive web application that enables students to interact with their campus on another level by allowing students to rate on-campus study spaces and food locations! It promotes social inclusiveness/sustainability and reduces food-waste by only going to the best restaurants.

### Study
To help locate students' optimal study spaces, StudyBite integrates campus building information with the collective student experience by allowing students to rate their experiences while studying throughout their campuses. Administrators can provide students with a map of the campus that incorporates study space availability and students can navigate their campus through our interactive map. Each student can select their optimal study spaces by factoring in past student experiences documented through our review system. Getting hungry but don't want to wait in line or unsure of what to get? StudyBite can also help with that!

### Bite
Through StudyBite's interactive food map, students can find new places to eat or pre-order food for pickup at registered food vendors. Students can browse through our website's catalogue of restaurants, menus, and reviews to satisfy their cravings without having to gamble on taste or food quality. Restaurant owners and admins can also manage their menus, item descriptions, and prices to keep students up to date.

## How we built it
Next.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Firebase, AWS, AdobeXD, Adobe Illustrator, Figma

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was the scope of our project. We did not have enough time to fully flesh out all of the features we had planned, but we hope to continue building onto our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing an impressive project within a 24-hour window.

StudyBite's assets were all hand-drawn which allowed our web app's design to have a unique and consistent feel which we augmented through our UI/UX design. Our developers worked hard to try and keep up with the designs.

## What we learned
For many of us, it was our first time participating in a hackathon and also our first times collaborating with people from various backgrounds. We each learned how to present and utilize our skills within a multidisciplinary setting to collaborate, architecture, and build a product.

## What's next for StudyBite
- Mobile application
- Support for multiple campuses
- Allowing students to find perfect study spaces by filtering
- Administrative control features
